# Poker Game in C#

This repository contains a **poker game** implemented in **C# from scratch**, utilizing the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern for hand evaluation. 

## Features
- **Custom Poker Engine** – Implements core poker mechanics, including hand dealing, betting, and hand ranking.
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** – Used to evaluate poker hands efficiently by passing responsibility through a chain of handlers.
- **Object-Oriented Design** – Modular structure for easy maintenance and future extensions.

## Technologies Used
- **C#** (.NET)
- **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern

## Context and Learning
When building this back then, I tried to minimize using generative AI chatbots and focus on understanding how the logic and OOP works. This project was a part of successfully passing the Object-Oriented Design Patterns course.

## Usage
Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/denisvejrazka/poker-chain.git
